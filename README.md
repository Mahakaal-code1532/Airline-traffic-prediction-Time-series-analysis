# Airline Traffic Prediction – Time Series Analysis

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for analyzing and forecasting airline passenger traffic using real-world time series data and a range of statistical and machine learning techniques.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Goal:** To analyze historical airline passenger data, uncover patterns, and forecast future trends.
- **Approach:** Covers data preprocessing, visualization, missing value and outlier handling, time series decomposition, and the application of multiple forecasting methods (e.g., Naive, Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA/SARIMA).
- **Tools Used:** Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, scikit-learn.

## 📂 Dataset
- Monthly airline passenger counts.
- Time series with clear trend and seasonality characteristics.
- (You may replace this section with your dataset’s source or upload instructions if needed.)

## 🔑 Features & Workflow
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Data import, datetime handling, and trend/seasonality visualization.
- **Preprocessing:** Filling missing values (mean, linear interpolation), and confirming outlier status.
- **Time Series Decomposition:** Additive and multiplicative decomposition for understanding components.
- **Forecasting Approaches:**
  - Naive Methods
  - Simple & Moving Average
  - Exponential Smoothing (Simple, Holt’s, Holt-Winters - Additive & Multiplicative)
  - Statistical Models (AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX)
- **Model Evaluation:** RMSE and MAPE computed for all methods, with side-by-side comparison.
- **Handling Stationarity:** BoxCox transformation, differencing, and formal tests (ADF, KPSS).
- **Hands-on Coding:** All processes clearly documented in a runnable Colab/Jupyter notebook.

## 📝 Real-World Applications
- Airline scheduling and resource planning
- Dynamic pricing and revenue management
- Airport and infrastructure development
- Scenario planning for crises or demand shocks
- Can adapt the method for forecasting in sales, weather, health, energy, and more

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Visual and tabular comparison of forecasting models.
- Guidance on selecting and improving time series models for new data.
